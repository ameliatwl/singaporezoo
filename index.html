<p>
<br><ins>Australasia</ins>
<br>
<br>While most of the world’s marsupials are found in Australia, marsupials also occur naturally in New Guinea, Indonesia and surrounding islands and the Americas. Besides the grey kangaroos and agile wallabies from Australia, this exhibit also showcases the tree kangaroos from Papua New Guinea.

<br>
<br><ins>Elephants of Asia</ins>
<br>
<br>Revered in Hinduism and Buddhism, elephants have profoundly influenced the Asian way of life since their domestication 4,000 years ago. Featuring Burmese-style architecture, this one-hectare exhibit showcases these largest of living land animals and their associated history and culture.

<br>
<br>Step into this 20,000 cubic metre biodome that mimics a tropical rainforest habitat. Come face-to-face with its furry and feathered inhabitants as you journey through the various strata of the rainforest. What's more, close encounters of the spineless kind await you at Discovery Outpost!

<br>
<br><ins>Primate Kingdom</ins>
<br>
<br>So why is this exhibit called Primate Kingdom? Each primate species is designated its own ‘island’. Add to that a landscaping of trees, a surrounding moat and you get ‘castles’ in which our furry rulers dwell. Here, our primates need not be king of the jungle to rule their own kingdom!

Open your eyes to the special skills and important roles that domesticated animals play in our lives in our Animal Friends Show.
<br>Many of our animals were once abandoned pets. Now, they make a difference by inspiring people every day to love and care for all animals with whom we share our forests as well as our homes. Catch the classic cat-and-mouse escapades that you usually see in cartoons come to life. See how a dog’s acute sense of smell comes to the rescue. And discover who’s capable of gravity-defying jumps.
<br>With plenty of laughs guaranteed, this show demonstrates how we can all get along – even cats and mice, and cats and dogs. Most of all, these domesticated performers inspire us to love and care for all animals – be it in the wild or within our own homes.
<br>And if you really want to show your love for our four-legged stars, feel free to pat and snap a photo with them after the show.

<p>
The Elephant Presentation showcases how magnificent these megaherbivores are. Besides sharing  interesting animal facts and details, our elephant keeper-presenters, who care for the elephants daily, will let you in on the unique quirks and personalities of our five female Asian elephants.
<br>No visit to Elephants of Asia is really complete without this experience of watching Komali, Jati, Gambir, Intan and Aprila forage, explore, and interact with one other and the keepers. You may just be one of the guests that gets to feed them.^ The animal presentation promises to be an educational experience, one that aims to foster and convey conservation awareness. Come find out how intelligent, sociable, strong and yet gentle elephants really are!
